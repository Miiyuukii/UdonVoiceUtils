## What is UVU?

**UdonVoiceUtils** is a selection of scripts and prefabs that can modify player audio settings in real time.

### TL;DR

Jump to [Installation](#installation) to get started... but I really recommend you read the given information here :)

### Example use cases

1. Increasing players voice range with e.g. a microphone
2. Separating players using audio zones/rooms
3. Muffling players behind walls
4. Muffling players standing behind other players
5. Scaling voice ranges depending on avatar height
6. Adding reverb to player voices and all audible audio
7. Creating complex stage setups with private backstage areas
8. Focusing player voices when they face you or you face them
9. Dividing players for competitive games using voice channels

## Getting started

Since **UdonVoiceUtils 1.0.0** the package can be added to your projects
via the **VRChat Creator Companion**.

### Versioning

This package is versioned using [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/).

The used pattern MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH indicates:

1. MAJOR version: incompatible API changes occurred
    - Implication: after updating backup, check and update your scenes/scripts as needed
2. MINOR version: new functionality has been added in a backward compatible manner
    - Implication: after updating check and update your usages if needed
3. PATCH version: backward compatible bug fixes were implemented
    - Implication: after updating remove potential workarounds you added

### Installation

1. Install/Add VRChat World SDK 3.7 to your project
2. Install/Add CyanPlayerObjectPool to your project: https://cyanlaser.github.io/CyanPlayerObjectPool/
3. Install/Add TLP UdonVoiceUtils to your project: https://guribo.github.io/TLP/
4. Start your project and open the scene `Packages/tlp.udonvoiceutils/Runtime/Scenes/Demo.unity`
5. With ClientSim enabled, click the Play button in Unity
6. Check for any errors in the console (only one regarding AudioListener is expected)
7. If there is any problems, please check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below
8. To set up your own world, start with the [Minimal Scene Setup](#minimal-scene-setup)

> **Additional Notes:**  
> Please follow the official guides created by VRChat to create a Unity World Creation project using the VRChat Create
> Companion.  
> The example scripts and prefabs can be found in `Packages/tlp.udonvoiceutils/Runtime/Prefabs/Examples`.
>
>  **Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Guribo/UdonVoiceUtils/wiki) for additional information on the
available components, features and prefabs before creating your own worlds. It mentions limitations and things to take
into account when integrating UVU into a VRChat world.**
>
> To see (and hear) how any of these features can be used feel free to test the example world with a friend or visit the
> public version [in VRChat](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_7ec7bbdd-ba81-4564-985a-c79dfc9eaca7).

### Minimal scene setup

1. In your **Project** windows in the search window type in "**TLP_**"
2. Filter the search results using the **Dropdown menu**, select: **In Packages**
3. Add **TLP_Essentials** prefab to your scene to get the core components
   - Note: `WorldVersionCheck` inside the prefab is optional and can be deleted from the scene
4. Add **TLP_PlayerAudioController** - *core system of UVU (mandatory)*
   - Alternatively you can use the prefab **TLP_PlayerAudioCompleteWithUi** if you want the menu as well

5. The minimum setup is now complete, but has no effect on any player by default.
6. From here on out you can either modify the global settings or add some of the example prefabs and connect them to the
   controller to create what you need. In addition, you can also create your own custom solutions that rely on UVU's
   audio overriding capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors after installation

1. Make sure [Cyan.PlayerObjectPool](https://cyanlaser.github.io/CyanPlayerObjectPool/) is added to your project!
2. You might have updated to a version of UdonUtils that is not yet compatible with UdonVoiceUtils
    1. Remove UdonVoiceUtils and UdonUtils from your project via the Creator companion
    2. Add **ONLY** UdonVoiceUtils again *(This will install the latest compatible version of UdonUtils for you as
       well)*

### *Something* is not working in the world

1. Always playtest in the Unity editor using client sim!
2. Check in the console for any errors
    1. Note that there should only be a single error regarding an AudioListener, which is expected and by design
3. Errors produced by my TLP packages can be clicked on and they will highlight the GameObject in your scene hierarchy
   that produced the error
4. Always start with the first error at the top!
5. Read the error messages, they usually tell you what is wrong.
    1. Usually it is something like `<Variable> is not set`
    2. Check that script and look for the variable name mentioned
    3. Set the missing variable, usually the related script that needs to be set there is part of the prefab
    4. Sometimes it makes sense to just start fresh with a clean prefab!

### Occlusion is not working

1. Make sure your colliders are on the `Environment` layer!
2. Walls must have a collision surface on either side to work in both directions!
    1. This is the case when using e.g. basic BoxColliders

## FAQ

### Can I use MeshColliders for occlusion?

**YES**

### How can I change the default/globally active settings?

1. Navigate to your PlayerAudioController prefab in your scene
2. Find the GameObject `Configurations/LocalConfiguration` inside it
3. Change its settings to your liking (this GameObject holds the active settings)
4. when using the menu: apply the same settings to the `Configurations/DefaultConfiguration`
   GameObject (this allows resetting the global settings back to your particular default values)
